         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y long abſence from this honourable Board, of which by Your Majeſties favour I am a member, may privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge me to beg licence for a few words: wherein I ſhall freely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Your Majeſtie and theſe Lords, my opinion concerning the preſent affaires of this Your diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and diſ-jointed Kingdome; which is ſo far out of frame &amp; order, by the occaſion of theſe long continued civill wars, that it hath need (and very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent need too it is) of all the means that can be uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and bring it into its old ſtate and condition. Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie and theſe Lords all know, with what integritie I have engaged my ſelfe and fortunes in Your Majeſties ſervice, and in it I did diſcharge the duty I was bound in to Your royall Majeſtie: But as much as I can with my beſt judgement gather in all my progreſſe about ſeverall parts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, during the proceſſe of theſe wars, it had been far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125344:3"/>they had never been begun at all; or ſince heaven for the ſins of this land hath ſuffered them to be begun, it were (in my poore opinion) extremely requiſite, for the ſafety and tranquillity of Your Majeſty, and of all us Your Subjects, that they were ſpeedily ended; they being juſtly to be reſembled to a violent diſeaſe, which if it be in the beginning of it reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with wholeſome medicines, may be overcome; if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to run too long, is hardly or not at all curable. For firſt, if we reſpect the conditions and affections of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eſpecially thoſe whom I have converſed with in <hi>Wales</hi> and elſewhere, we ſhall finde them very difficult to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take Your Majeſties quarrell againſt the high Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the very name whereof is ſo firmly and with that reverence rooted in the breſts of the Engliſh Nation, nay in the hearts of the very mountainers of <hi>Wales,</hi> that with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined faith they beleeve and ſo far, as they dare affirme that the Parliament is in the right, that Your Majeſty is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ill counſelled againſt the Parliaments proceedings, which have alwayes been ſo happy to the Kings of this Realme Your anceſtors: and with an infallible confidence they proteſt they can never be drawn willingly to take up armes againſt thoſe honourable and faithfull men, that were by their owne choice elected and appointed to look after the affairs of the Kingdome, to treat in Councell for the amendment of the diſorders of the Common-wealth, which before this preſent Seſſion of Parliament were grown up to a formidable and oppreſſive number, to the great prejudice of the liberty and property of the Subject. So that thoſe few men which I have been able to draw in thoſe parts to your Majeſties ſervice are for the moſt part men of mean for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and ſuch too in whom we may or can repoſe no great confidence, ſince they may be imagined to come to theſe wars rather for feare then affection, and where men come to employ their hands againſt their hearts there can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no great expreſſion of courage, much leſſe of fidelitie. For moneys (ſo pleaſe Your Majeſty) I muſt really informe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125344:3"/>You, that in all thoſe parts where I have been converſant there is little or none at all to be procured, at leaſt for Your Majeſties aſſiſtance: The Gentry and people of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cry out, they cannot poſſibly part with that which they have not, their ſtores being quite exhauſted by former pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and if ſome of them for feare (whom we were ſure had money) were won to part with ſome ſmall pittance out of it, they as ſoon as their backes were turned from us, with much murmur exclaimed, that their money was extorted and borrowed from them by force; that to prevent taking away the whole they were glad to forgoe part of their eſtates. So that by theſe expreſſions your Majeſty and theſe Lords may plainly perceive which way the game will goe, when Your neceſſities ſhall compell Your Highneſſe to ſtand in moſt need of aſſiſtance or ſupply from their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Beſides, an exceeding murmur is rife in every mans mouth in <hi>Wales</hi> and the borders thereof, that Your Majeſty (contrary to Your expreſſions and Declararations) doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain daily great ſtore of convicted Popiſh Recuſants into Your ſervice, as they inſtance in my Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> ſon to the Earle of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> whoſe Forces are compounded almoſt altogether of ſuch publicke Delinquents, enemies to the true Proteſtant Religion: And the name of Papiſt is ſo execrably odious to the People in generall, for their former treacherous practices againſt the State and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that they doe confidently now believe, ſince ſuch men are permitted to fight under your Majeſties Enſignes, that they are diſplayed merely for the ruine and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their liberties; that thoſe malevolents to Gods true Religion, muſt needs be drawne together, to overthrow the true and ſincere profeſſion of it in your Majeſties Dominions, and ſo poſſeſſed with theſe feares, which (conſidering the perſons) are not altogether vaine or cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they ſuggeſt to themſelves a thouſand ſtrange chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraes of dangers, all which, their imagination leads them to believe, are derivative from your Majeſty and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125344:4"/>your Counſellors, that permit the publike foes to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Common-wealth to be armed, pay, put ſwords into their deſperate and ill governed hands.</p>
            <p>Nor are theſe all the inconveniences or diſadvantages that my obſervation hath aſſured me muſt wait upon your Majeſty in the continuance of theſe warres (if we ſhould be ſo unhappy as to ſee them continue) your Majeſties for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are daily impaired and diminiſhed, without any hopes of ſupplies, unleſſe it were poſſible the arteries of your ſlaughtered ſouldiers could againe take life, and riſe up to your Majeſties ſervice; the Parliaments armie on the contrary ſide being certain to be reinforced with freſh men whenſoever any of the old ones fall, either by the hand of warre or ſickneſſe, the whole Kingdome being, as it were, at their devotion, all the able men thereof run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with willing hearts and couragious hands, to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice their lives in the Parliaments quarrell, which they conceive to be the common quarrell of the Kingdome, the quarrell for their wives and children, eſtates and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a variety and labyrinth of diſadvantages, walks the army now waiting on your Majeſty; and ſo ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the other, that by the view of their ſtrength, we may eaſily ſurvey our owne urgent infirmities. And which is of all the accidents of this war the moſt to be lamented, is, that wee are ingaged brothers againſt brothers, friends againſt friends, nay, parents againſt their dearely beloved children, and ſonnes againſt their fathers, the whole land fraught with nothing but the horrors of warre and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: true Religion in the meane time is neglected and trampled upon; the Lawes (which are the Subjects beſt property, and the Soveraignes largeſt prerogative) being deſpiſed and villified, and every thing changed from the calmneſſe of its owne genuine condition into diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fury: the Parliament, which had wont to be the ableſt bulwarke of the Kingdome, the Subjects ſecurity,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125344:4"/>and the Kings conſtant ayder and ſupplement in all his neceſſities, rent from your Majeſty, and your Majeſty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from them; ſo that that ſupreme Councell (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated to ſettle the diſtempers of the Common-wealth, to enact good and wholeſome Lawes for the defence and advancement of the Subjects liberty) is inforced to ſpend all that precious time which might and ſhould have been imployed as aforeſaid, upon the compoſure of theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and in agitating meanes for the Lawes and the Kingdomes defence.</p>
            <p>Wee our ſelves, who were Peers and fellowes in that honourable ſociety, being voted out of our places and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; and, ſo pleaſe your Majeſty, if your royall ſelfe and theſe Lords will but ſeriouſly conſider the nature and proportion of their gaines and loſſes in theſe warres, your ſacred ſelfe, and all of them ſhall eaſily finde the loſſe to be the onely thing that can be gotten by theſe warres. Loſſe your Majeſty is ſure to have of your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, loſſe in your revenue, loſſe in your magnificence, and the extent of your regality being, as it were, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed to this City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and deprived of the poſſeſſion of your royall Palaces, in and about your City of <hi>London,</hi> which would to God your Majeſtie had never left, and then theſe fatall miſchiefes had either not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at all, or at leaſtwiſe not beene of this laſting and lamentable continuance. For my part, and ſo I may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme of all theſe Lords, wee loſe as much as wee have by theſe warres. Firſt, we loſe our repute with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and conſequently with the Common-wealth; wee loſe the injoyment of our eſtates, which are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Parliament forfeits to the uſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; which is deareſt of all to mortall men, we loſe the affection and ſociety of all our brethren, friends and allies, divers of which in this quarrell are our utter enemies. But I ſhall tranſgreſſe my duty, and tire your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with too tedious amplification of the inconveniences
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:125344:5"/>of theſe preſent wars, the zeale I have to your Majeſties ſervice, and the good of the Common-wealth, renders me beyond my owne nature, conſcious of this prolixity, whoſe onely aime is to beſeech your Majeſty, for the honour you beare to Gods cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the love you carry in your royall thoughts to us your dutifull ſervants, and to all your Subjects in generall, to thinke of ſome meanes for a ſudden Accommodation of peace betwixt your ſelfe and your high Court of Parliament: nothing can be more acceptable to God then the bringing this peace to paſſe, nor more fortunate and proſperous to your people. So have I freely, with your Majeſties licence, delivered my faithfull opinion and counſell, which I ſhall hourely pray may ſuite to as good an effect as I intended it.</p>
